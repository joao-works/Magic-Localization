## ✨ The Magic Localization Initiative
Hello! And welcome to the Magic Localization Initiative. This is the community language repository for [Magic](https://magic.joogps.com).

If you'd like to have your language supported by Magic and know how to use Git, feel free to make a pull request to this repositry and add it. Please follow the guidelines too!

## Supported languages
- English
- Portuguese

### Pending
- French
- German
- Spanish

## Guidelines

Before you contribute, please make sure that you follow these guidelines:

- First, clone this repository to your local machine.
- The currently supported languages are stored in the root directory of this repository with filenames `language_code.strings`. Some languages are already translated by a machine and are exclusively pending voluntary verification. These can be found in the [pending](/pending) directory.
- If you want to verify a pending language, open the file in your computer and check all of the strings for errors – then move the file to the root directory and open a pull request. If you want to chenge an already supported language, just make changes to the file and explain your reasoning in the pull request.

If the language you're adding is not in the `pending` section, you can either create an issue for me to create that file for you or do it yourself in a new pull request – it's up to you!

There is also a [previews.txt](previews.txt) file that contains the text used for the app previews of Magic – you can optionally add your language to it with the same format as the other languages – . Finally, the [descriptions.txt](descriptions.txt) file contains the text used for the app description of Magic – you can also optionally add your language to it with the same format as the other languages.

## What you get

But hey! Your work is worth a lot. If you contribute to this repository, you'll get your name in the app's credits associated with the language you contributed with. In addition, I'll personally send you a promo code to Magic+ for 6 months.

## Thank you
